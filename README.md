How to Play:
Spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates know the agents only by their
codenames.
Spymasters take turns giving one-word clues. A clue may relate to multiple words on the table. The field
operatives try to guess which words their spymaster meant. When a field operative touches a word, the
spymaster reveals its secret identity. If the field operatives guess correctly, they may continue guessing,
until they run out of ideas for the given clue or until they hit a wrong person. Then it is the other team's
turn to give a clue and guess. The first team to contact all their agents wins the game.
